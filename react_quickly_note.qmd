## Chapter 2

See `2.1 Create a new React app` for `npm` command.

```
Success! Created name-of-app at <folder>
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
 
  npm start
    Starts the development server.
 
  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.
 
  npm test
    Starts the test runner.
 
  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration
    files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you
    can't go back!
 
We suggest that you begin by typing:
 
  cd name-of-app
  npm start
 
Happy hacking!
